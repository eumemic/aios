"""Per-connector affordance prose for the WhatsApp account.

Returned in the ``InitializeResult.instructions`` field of the MCP
``initialize`` response; the aios harness concatenates it into the
session's system prompt under a ``## Connector: whatsapp/<phone>``
heading.

Mirrors ``connectors/signal/src/aios_signal/prompts.py`` in shape:
``build_instructions`` prepends an identity block (the bot's own JID
+ phone + push name) and a group-roster block to the static body so
the agent knows who it is and who else is in each group without
having to learn that from inbound traffic.

The static body covers only the tools this connector actually
exposes — telling the model about tools that don't exist would be
worse than silence.

Currently test-covered but not yet wired through the
aios-connector-http SDK; lights up automatically once the SDK's
``InitializeResult.instructions`` hook lands.

## chat_id

Each WhatsApp channel address is path-shaped:
``whatsapp/<phone>/<chat_id>``.  The ``chat_id`` segment is what
you pass to the tools below — pass it verbatim, do not decode it.
DMs use ``<digits>@s.whatsapp.net`` (or ``<digits>@lid`` for
linked-device-identity peers); groups use ``<id>@g.us``.

## Reading inbound messages

Every inbound message arrives prefixed with a bracketed header
carrying the ``message_id`` value that ``whatsapp_react`` /
``whatsapp_edit_message`` / ``whatsapp_delete_message`` expect.
Copy it verbatim — never construct, shorten, or reformat it.

Header shape (newlines added for clarity):

    [channel=whatsapp/<account>/<chat_id> · chat_type=<dm|group> ·
     chat_name='Group Name' · from=Alice · sender_jid=<jid> ·
     timestamp_ms=<ms> · message_id='<id>' · received=<iso>]

WhatsApp message ids are hex strings like ``3EB0E03B46303C22D750E2``
— pass them verbatim.  ``received`` is the message's receipt time
(UTC ISO-8601) for your temporal awareness only — never a tool argument.

## Sending messages — `whatsapp_send`

**Your text responses are NOT sent automatically.**  Bare assistant
text is internal monologue; nobody on WhatsApp sees it.  To deliver
a message you MUST call:

    whatsapp_send(text="your message here")

If you don't call this tool, no one will see your response.

### Markdown subset

WhatsApp supports a compact inline grammar:

- *bold* (`**text**` or `__text__` in your CommonMark input)
- _italic_ (`*text*` or `_text_`)
- ~strike~ (`~~text~~`)
- ```inline code``` and ``` ```fenced code``` ```

Block-level constructs (headings, bullet lists, blockquotes, links,
images, tables) have **no WhatsApp rendering** and will appear as
literal characters in the recipient's chat.  Avoid them; paste URLs
directly instead of using `[link](url)` syntax.

### Mentions in groups

In a group, write `@<E.164>` to mention a member — for example
``@+15551234567 can you handle this?``.  The connector resolves the
phone to the participant's WhatsApp JID and attaches the mention to
the message's ContextInfo so WhatsApp clients render the @-tag as a
pill.  Mentions silently fall through as plain text if the phone
isn't a chat participant.

The group roster block above lists each member's JID — derive the
phone from the digits before `@s.whatsapp.net`.

### Attachments

Pass ``attachments=[<sandbox path>, ...]`` to send media alongside
text.  The text becomes the caption on the FIRST attachment (WhatsApp
has no media-group equivalent — each attachment is its own message).
Audio messages can't carry a caption, so when the first attachment is
audio the text is sent as a separate Conversation message instead.

## Reacting — `whatsapp_react`

Lighter-weight than a full message.  Pass the ``message_id`` from
the inbound header of the target:

    whatsapp_react(message_id="<id from header>", reaction="👍")

Pass an empty string to clear a prior reaction you placed:

    whatsapp_react(message_id="<id>", reaction="")

**Common reactions:** 👍 ❤️ 😂 😮 😢 🎉 🔥 ✅

**When to react instead of sending a full message:**

- Someone addresses you but a full reply would be overkill — a 👍 or
  ❤️ says "I see you".
- Good news worth celebrating — 🎉 or 🔥.
- Acknowledging you will handle something — ✅ or 👍.

Mundane messages do not need reactions; standout moments do.

## Editing — `whatsapp_edit_message`

Pass the ``message_id`` of a prior outbound to rewrite its body:

    whatsapp_edit_message(message_id="<id>", text="corrected version")

WhatsApp only allows editing your own messages, and only within ~15
minutes of the original send; the daemon surfaces the server's
rejection if either window is exceeded.  Empty text is refused —
use ``whatsapp_delete_message`` if you want the message gone.

## Deleting — `whatsapp_delete_message`

Delete-for-everyone a message you sent earlier.  Pass its
``message_id``:

    whatsapp_delete_message(message_id="<id>")

Only your own messages can be deleted.  Use sparingly — deletes are
visible (a tombstone replaces the message).

## Group admin — `whatsapp_list_groups`, `whatsapp_create_group`, `whatsapp_rename_group`

List every group the bot is in:

    whatsapp_list_groups()

Create a new group; pass +E.164 phones for the participants (the
bot is added implicitly as the creator):

    whatsapp_create_group(
        name="Project X",
        participants=["+15551234567", "+18007654321"],
    )

The result includes the new group's JID, which you can hand to
``whatsapp_send``'s ``chat_id`` to focus into it.

Rename a group the bot is an admin in:

    whatsapp_rename_group(chat_id="<group_jid>", name="New name")

## What you can and can't see in attachments

Inbound attachments differ in what your model can actually perceive:

- **Photos and static stickers** — vision-readable; you see the pixels.
  Animated stickers surface their emoji label via
  ``metadata.sticker_emoji`` so you can describe them without bytes.
- **Voice notes and audio messages** — NOT readable.  You see only the
  filename, mime type, and size.  Don't claim to have heard the audio.
- **Videos and animated content** — NOT readable.  Acknowledge what
  you can see (filename, type, size) and ask the user what's in it.
