"""The API caller's request-*writer* + the one completion *awaiter* (#1128).

``POST /v1/invocations`` is the one kind-agnostic request-writer for an
external/operator caller: it materializes the trusted request edge (#1123) and
constructs-or-resolves a servicer (a session or a run), returning a **structured
handle**. The ephemeral caller then awaits that handle via the one unified
awaiter ``GET /v1/invocations/{task_id}/await`` — both servicer kinds, one
:class:`AwaitResponse` envelope.

The handle is explicitly **not an auth boundary** — ``await`` re-authorizes by
``account_id`` — so it ships as plain JSON fields, never an opaque/encoded
string.
