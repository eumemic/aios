"""Connection endpoints — CRUD plus mode-binding transitions.

Created in detached mode; switch to single_session via ``attach`` or
per_chat via ``configure-per-chat``.  ``DELETE`` soft-archives — but
only on detached connections (the service layer enforces this so
operators can't silently break inbound delivery for live single_session
connections or orphan ``spawned_from_connection_id`` pointers on
per_chat-spawned sessions).

``attach`` validates the connection's ``account`` against the connector
subprocess's current snapshot (audit fix #1, design §5.6) — without
this guard an operator can permanently attach a connection for an
account the connector no longer serves, and inbound silently drops with
the ``account_drift`` counter ticking up.  The validation flows through
procrastinate RPC like the rest of ``/v1/connectors/*``: API mints a
ULID, LISTENs on ``connector_result_<call_id>``, defers
``harness.connector_status``, awaits NOTIFY.  ~50-200ms latency on an
admin-only endpoint is invisible.
